# COMP2160Project
Our project will be an app which will point out various celestial objects (like planets and moons) through the camera. Obviously the app won't be able to provide a crystal clear view of them, but will be able to detect their position in the sky. We will try to include as many objects as possible, but may limit it depending on how difficult it is to implement.
